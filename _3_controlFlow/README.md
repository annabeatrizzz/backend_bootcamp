# Control Flow Challenge
This challenge was designed to practice Java skills in Control Flow (Conditional Structures, Repeting Structures, and Exceptions).

## Instructions
To practice all the content presented in the Flow Control module let's code the following scenario.

The system should receive two parameters via the terminal that represent two integers. With these two numbers, you should obtain the number of interactions (for) and print the incremented numbers on the console (System.out.print), for example:

- If you pass the numbers 12 and 30, then we will have an interaction (for) with 18 occurrences to print the numbers, example: "Printing the number 1", "Printing the number 2" and so on.
- If the first parameter is GREATER than the second parameter, you should throw a customized exception called ParametersInvalidException with the second message: "The second parameter must be greater than the first"
  
Create the **controlFlow** project:

Inside the project, create the **Counter** class to do all the coding for our program.

Inside the project, create the **ParametersInvalidException** class which will represent the business exception in the system.

## Topics Practiced
- Using Scanner to get input from users
