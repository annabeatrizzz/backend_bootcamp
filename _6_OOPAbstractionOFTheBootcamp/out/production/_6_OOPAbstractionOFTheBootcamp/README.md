# OOP Challenge Abstracting the Bootcamp

## Instructions
For this project the goal is to ABSTRACT the Bootcamp DOMAIN and MODEL with its ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS. 
We'll create the following CLASSES: Bootcamp, src.Courses, src.Mentorships and Devs and relate them. 
The CLASSES Course, Mentorship and Devs will also be MODELED, i.e. we'll create their ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS. 
To make the code more readable and easier to maintain, we'll use some of the tools that the OBJECT ORIENTATION PARADIGM (OOP) offers us: ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM. 
And to represent CLASSES that have been created and related, we will transform them into OBJECTS.

## Topics Practiced
- Object Oriented Programming
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polimorphism
