# Bank Simulation Challenge 

This challenge was designed to practice Java basic programming skills.

## Instructions
Create the project bankSimulation that will receive data via terminal containing the characteristics of a bank account according to the attributes below:
Within the project, create the class TerminalAccount.java to perform all the coding for our program.
Review the rules for variable declaration.

|Attribute | Type | Example|
| -- | -- | -- |  
|Number | Integer | 1021 |
|Agency | Text | 067-8 |
|Client Name | Text | MARIO ANDRADE | 
|Balance | Decimal | 237.48 |

Review about terminal, main args, and the Scanner class.
Allow the data to be entered via terminal, with the user receiving a message requesting the information, for example:
Program: "Please enter the Agency number!"
User: 1021 (then ENTER for the next field)
Review about concatenation and the String class with the concat method.
After all the information has been entered, the system should display the following message:
"Hello [Client Name], thank you for creating an account with our bank. Your agency is [Agency], account [Number], and your balance [Balance] is now available for withdrawal."

The fields in [ ] should be replaced by the information entered by the users.

## Topics Practiced
